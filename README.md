# Hi, I'm Taylor

I studied Diplomacy, got an MBA, and spent years as a PM/PMM at Amazon. Not exactly a traditional path into code.

But when I inherited a broken process with a 15-case backlog, zero data infrastructure, and no BI team to help -- I had two options: wait for resources that weren't coming, or figure it out myself.

I taught myself SQL on Amazon Redshift and built a 689-attribute tracking system from scratch. When a 55MB Excel file kept crashing and killing our selection process, I replaced it with a 6-step SQL architecture. When I needed to calculate distances between 130,000+ station pairs, I learned R and implemented geodesic formulas. Each skill was acquired because a specific problem demanded it and nobody else was going to solve it.

Now I build with Python. Same pattern -- find what's broken, build what's missing.

## What I'm Building

**[Claude-Innit](https://github.com/tstephx/Claude-Innit)** -- Persistent memory for Claude Code sessions. SQLite + FTS5 + semantic embeddings via MCP, so context carries across conversations instead of starting from zero every time.

**[Book Library MCP Server](https://github.com/tstephx/book-mcp-server)** -- 40+ tool MCP server that turns 130+ books into a searchable, AI-queryable knowledge base. Semantic search, study guides, reading progress, and project planning from your own library.

**[Book Ingestion Pipeline](https://github.com/tstephx/book-ingestion-python)** -- Processes PDFs and EPUBs into structured, searchable chapters with embeddings. The data layer that powers everything above.

## How I Think

I come from operations and product -- not computer science. That shapes how I build:

- **Start with the problem, not the tech.** Every project here exists because something was slow, manual, or broken.
- **Data first.** If it can't be measured, it can't scale. SQL, analytics, and metrics are the foundation.
- **Build to last.** Clean architecture, real documentation, and systems that work without me babysitting them.
- **Learn by doing.** Self-taught means every repo is a lesson. The commit history is the curriculum.

## Tech I Work With

Python | SQL | SQLite + FTS5 | MCP (Model Context Protocol) | Semantic Search | LLMs | Bash | HTML/CSS | Git

## Background

Program Manager and Product Manager with an MBA from UW Foster. Three promotions in three years at Amazon. I've managed programs that protected $25M+ in business value, built data systems tracking 689+ attributes, and led cross-functional work across 8+ teams.

Now I channel that same energy into building tools.
